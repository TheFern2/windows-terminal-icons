# windows-terminal-icons

[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) is great, but when building profiles it doesn't provide default icons for profiles. This repo is created to solve this issue. A new profile build shouldn't take 10 min editing a json + looking for an icon.

# Contributions

If you have an icon in mind, contributions and pull requests are welcome. You can also open an issue and make a suggestion, or improvement for the current icon set.
